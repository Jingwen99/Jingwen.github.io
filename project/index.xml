&lt;p&gt;Identified factors influencing the prizewinning effect on winners and coauthors, including disciplines, award year, publication recency, and award age and winner’s gender by using polynomial regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employed Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to analyze the individual treatment effect of prizewinning, utilizing Stata and R for statistical analysis to ensure robustness in the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzed the mediation effects of prizewinning on coauthors’ papers via winner-coauthor network ties, employing network analysis tools such as Gephi and Python&#39;s NetworkX library to visualize and quantify network changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transmission Mechanism of Geopolitical Risks on the Energy Market.</title>
      <link>https://Jingwen99.github.io/project/geo/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://Jingwen99.github.io/project/geo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a two-stage geopolitical risk analysis approach, integrating statistics, econometrics, macroeconomics, and behavioral finance theories, to analyze the transmission mechanisms of geopolitical risk to the oil market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collected oil-related data from Thomson Reuters, WIND, Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis, and U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), enabling rapid collection and extraction of valid data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilized the time-varying parametric vector autoregressive (TVPVAR) model to demonstrate how geopolitical risk influences oil prices through various transmission paths, including micro and macro media—including oil supply, demand, inventory, speculative behavior, and economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrated that speculative behavior intensifies during periods of elevated geopolitical risk, significantly impacting oil prices through fluctuations in market positions (long and short).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identified that the predominant effect of geopolitical tensions is to drive up oil prices by dampening economic activity, establishing a critical pathway of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-published the paper Transmission Mechanisms of Geopolitical Risks to the Crude Oil Market—a pioneering two-stage geopolitical risk analysis approach as the first author.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Dynamic Time Series of Oil Price</title>
      <link>https://Jingwen99.github.io/project/ml/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://Jingwen99.github.io/project/ml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Utilized a combination of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Tree, and Graph Attention Network models within the conformal prediction framework to forecast oil prices. Incorporated geopolitical factors for enhanced insights into energy market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed aggregation functions to integrate multiple predictions, facilitating statistical inference and the construction of prediction intervals for future oil prices, with an emphasis on managing uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conducted a comprehensive review of over 20 scholarly papers focused on the application of evolutionary and behavioral game-theoretic models in developing strategies for low-carbon energy trading and enhancing global climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employed network science techniques to analyze the strategic interactions and commitment levels among countries in international climate change mitigation efforts, mapping complex networks to illustrate these relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed data-driven frameworks to summarize how climate-related risks (both physical and transitional) propagate through financial markets, impacting credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks across different geographic regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilized system dynamics modeling to investigate the cascading effects of extreme climate events on economic growth within interconnected climate-social systems, highlighting the role of network analysis in understanding systemic vulnerabilities and response mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
